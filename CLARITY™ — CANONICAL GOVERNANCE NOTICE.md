# PURPOSE DECLARATION

This document **is deemed** to establish Clarity™’s governance position prior to any specific exposure, investigation, or review. It **constitutes** the definition of authority, recorded control, and decision accountability independent of any triggering event. Its validity **cannot** be contingent on inquiry, dispute, or outcome. This document **is treated as** the governing record against which actions and omissions **are deemed**evaluated.
# THE GOVERNANCE LAW

Silence **is treated as** a decision, not an absence of one. Authority **is deemed** to transfer as time advances, not by request or permission. Consequence **constitutes** execution independent of awareness, approval, or consent. All actions, inactions, and resulting states **are deemed** recorded, and once recorded **cannot** be altered.

# THE ADOPTION TRIGGER

Governance **must** be present at the exact moment authorization is given. Authorization **constitutes** the point at which authority is exercised and risk **is deemed** active, and any governance not in place at that moment **cannot** apply to the decision. Documentation created after authorization **is deemed** reconstruction and **cannot** establish control or legitimacy. Such records **constitute** aftermath, not governance. Any delay between authorization and governance **constitutes**exposure, as authority operates without constraint, oversight, or binding record, causing risk to accumulate irreversibly.

# THE LIABILITY COVERAGE

When rules and control are not in place at the moment a decision is approved, exposure **is deemed** created. This exposure **constitutes** liability regardless of whether the work is completed or abandoned, and regardless of operating pressure. Substantive correctness **cannot** negate exposure when governance is absent at authorization. Responsibility **is deemed** to remain attached to the decision even when no formal rule, control, or mandate existed at execution.

# THE DELAY INVALIDATION

Once exposure is known, any gap in authority **constitutes** a governance failure. Evaluation, review, or assessment **cannot**suspend responsibility or defer accountability. Delay **cannot** be used as a defense, justification, or mitigating factor. Responsibility **is deemed** continuous from the moment exposure is identifiable, irrespective of elapsed time or internal process.
